# Weather App

A simple weather application built with React.js, Axios, and styled-components. This project demonstrates my skills in frontend development, UI design, and working with 3rd party APIs.

## Features

- Responsive and intuitive UI design
- Styled-components for styling

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Add your OpenWeatherMap API key in `src/App.js`
4. Run the application: `npm start`
